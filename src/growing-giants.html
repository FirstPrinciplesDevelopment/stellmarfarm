                            that opened that
                            morning. Remove the male flower petals so you have a 4 inch stem and the stamen. Gently rub

                            the larva as
                            they
                            hatch. Spray the main trunk and runners every 5 to 7 days with any of the pesticides
                            mentioned above.
                            Aphids:
                            Look for aphids under the leaves. You must get Malathion, Thiodan or other aphid pesticide
                            directly on the
                            aphids to kill them.

                            MILDEW CONTROL: Atlantic Giant pumpkins are not as prone to mildews as regular Pumpkins. If
                            it is a problem,
                            good insect control will minimize spreading these diseases. Use fungicides like
                            Ridmil‑Bravo, Daconil,
                            Bayleton,
                            Benlate‑Manzate or a combination vegetable disease control product as recommended on the
                            package. Some of
                            these
                            products are expensive and may require a permit to buy and use.
